# Hand Gesture Mouse Control Project

This project uses **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Python** to control the mouse with hand gestures via your webcam.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system
- VS Code installed
- Webcam connected and working
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts in VS Code

---

## Step 1: Open the Project in VS Code

1. Launch **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click **File > Open Folder**.
3. Select the project folder containing your scripts (`gesture_mouse.py` and `util.py`).
4. Open the integrated terminal by clicking **Terminal > New Terminal**.

---

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

In the VS Code terminal:

### On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
You should see (venv) prefix in the terminal prompt, indicating the environment is activated.

Step 3: Install Required Packages
Run this command in the activated environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you donâ€™t have requirements.txt, create it with the following packages:

Copy
Edit
opencv-python
mediapipe
pyautogui
pynput
numpy
Step 4: Run the Gesture Mouse Control Script
Make sure your webcam is connected.

In the terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python gesture_mouse.py
A window will open showing your webcam feed.

Show your hand clearly in front of the camera.

The program will detect your hand and respond to gestures like mouse movement and clicks.

Step 5: How to Stop the Program and Turn Off the Camera
Click the video window and press the q key to quit and close the webcam.

Or, go to the terminal and press Ctrl + C to forcibly stop the program.

The camera will be released automatically upon exit.

Troubleshooting
If the window doesnâ€™t show or hand is not detected, ensure:

Good lighting and a clear background.

Your webcam is working with other applications.

You activated the virtual environment before running.

If you get errors about missing packages, run pip install -r requirements.txt again.

Additional Notes
For any modifications, edit gesture_mouse.py and util.py files.

Always activate the virtual environment before running the script.

To exit the virtual environment, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
deactivate
